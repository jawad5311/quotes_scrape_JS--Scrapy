# Scrap data from JS site using splash & scrapy

Scrape all the quotes, authors, and tags from a JS enabled site (quotes.toscrape.com/js).

The content on this site is displayed through JavaScript so, it can't be scrapped using scrapy only.

Go to the **spiders** directory and see the _quotes.py_ crawler with comments for easy understanding.
